        <h2 id="history">Our History</h3>
      <p>
    BuildNRun was founded by two Nigerian teenagers, Edem Gold and Breakthrough Makanjuola, who are determined to help businesses in Africa get online quickly and affordably. Edem and Breakthrough each had unique skill sets that complemented each other perfectly.
  </p>

  <p>
     Edem was an expert in coding and the technical aspects of building websites and managing teams, while Breakthrough was a natural when it came to talking to people and marketing the services. Together, they assembled a team of expert developers and designers who shared their passion for making a difference, and they've since helped hundreds of businesses get online and reach new customers.

        <h2> How we hope to build e-stores for everyone in Africa</h2>
        <p>
        While we see everyone who sells in Africa as our target market, our main focus, as of now, will be people who operate physical stores, where we hope to discuss the advantages moving e-stores provide, in other words, we will develop outreach programs for physical store owners where we discuss the benefits of moving to e-stores. We hope to educate physical store owners on how eCommerce stores can help them reach a wider audience and expand their business.
      </p>

      <p>
      Our second focus would be entrepreneurs who sell via social media but do not have access to (due to cost) physical locations, we hope to provide e-store development services along with services such as SEO techniques, etc, which will enable these unique entrereneurs move their businesses to the next level to individuals.
